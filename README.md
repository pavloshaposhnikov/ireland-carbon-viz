# Ireland Carbon Visualization

This is a project I built as part of my application for the MSc in Statistics and Sustainability at Trinity College Dublin. 

I wanted to show how Ireland's electricity system works and its impact on the environment. The app visualizes carbon emissions from electricity generation using data from Ireland's grid operator (EirGrid) and European energy data (ENTSO-E).

## What This App Does

The app shows:
- How much COâ‚‚ Ireland produces when making electricity
- Which energy sources Ireland uses (wind, gas, coal, etc.)
- How this changes throughout the day and week
- The difference between mock data and realistic Irish patterns

## Why I Built This

I'm applying to study Statistics and Sustainability at Trinity College Dublin. This project shows I can:

- **Use data** to understand environmental problems
- **Build web apps** that make data easy to understand  
- **Work with real-world data** from Ireland's electricity system
- **Show the connection** between energy choices and climate change

## Data Sources

I used data from:
- **EirGrid** - Ireland's electricity grid operator
- **ENTSO-E** - European energy data
- **Mock data** - For testing and development

The app currently uses simulated data that follows real Irish electricity patterns.

## How to Run This

1. **Install Node.js** (version 20+)
2. **Download the project**
3. **Run these commands:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
4. **Open your browser** to `http://localhost:5173`

## What I Learned

This project taught me:
- How to build web apps with React
- How to work with real electricity data
- How to make data easy to understand with charts
- How Ireland's electricity system works
- The connection between energy and climate change
